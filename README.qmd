First attempt at a basic data dictionary for indicators used at DataHaven. Edits are done in Airtable, then loaded into a duckdb database (`gloss.duckdb`). This database is also made available in tagged releases in this repo and on the Motherduck platform (contact Camille if you want access). The release should facilitate building an R package to query sets of definitions easily, e.g. all indicators used in a specific project, or all indicators associated with a certain source. 

The tables in the database are:

```{python}
import duckdb
con = duckdb.connect('gloss.duckdb', read_only=True)
con.sql('SELECT table_name, estimated_size AS rows, column_count AS columns FROM duckdb_tables() ORDER BY table_name;').show()
con.close()
```
Workflows are managed with snakemake, as shown:

```{python}
!snakemake --filegraph | dot -T png > dag.png
```
